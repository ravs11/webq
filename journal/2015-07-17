done:
-----
    1 added a configuration file for TokenGen with which we can easily add more TokenGen peers to the system.
    2 send and recieve queue lengths to peer tokenGen
    3 better way to calucuate the average wait time for both peers and hosts.
    4 Algorithm to allocate capacity to the gen based on the transfered queue:

                                                    (host wait time)
        >  share = total_usable_capacity * ------------------------------
                                            (host wait time+peer wait time)
    5 Capacity Estimator communicates with all the TokenGens
tested:
-------
    1) Capacity fixed at 15. Each of the TokenGen has a load rate of 15 req/sec.
    2) Capacity is discoverd by the CapEst. Each TokenGen has  a load rate of 15 req/sec

Inferances:
-----------
    1) result is averaged over 2 seconds.
    2) Dont allocate to full capacity ( to take care of the n/w delay )
        Overallocation happending: due to n/w delay .. actual allocated capcity 
        should be less than the available capacity.

to Test:
-------
    Test with more token gens, for higher duration/load
